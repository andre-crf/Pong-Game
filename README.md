# CS50 Pong Game

#### Description:
I am thrilled to present my final project developed for the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course: the CS50 Pong Game. This project is not just a milestone in my academic journey but also a tribute to one of the most iconic video games in history. Drawing inspiration from the classic Pong game, it has been meticulously crafted using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, resulting in an immersive gaming experience accessible from any modern browser.

Game Features:

Simple and Intuitive Interface: We prioritized a clean and easy-to-understand interface, ensuring players of all ages can engage with the game effortlessly.
Classic Pong Gameplay: Relive the magic of Pong with two paddles and a ball, challenging friends or the computer in thrilling matches.
Score Counting: Keep the competition fierce with a scoring system that records each player's successes, encouraging the pursuit of victory.
Dynamic Ball Speed Adjustment: As the match progresses, the ball's speed increases, raising the challenge level and keeping the game exciting and engaging.
End Game System: At the end of each match, players receive victory or defeat messages, encouraging reflection on the game and strategy for future matches.
Simple AI for the Computer Paddle: We developed a basic artificial intelligence capable of providing a good challenge, adapting to the player's progress.
Design Decisions:

Use of HTML5 Canvas: Choosing HTML5 Canvas to render the game elements was crucial for ensuring a smooth and pleasant visual experience, allowing for the creation of dynamic graphics directly in the browser.
Minimalist Style: We opted for a minimalist design, not only to honor the simplicity of the original Pong but also to focus on gameplay without distractions.
Gradual Increase in Ball Speed: This mechanic was designed to make the game progressively more challenging, encouraging players to improve their skills and strategies over time.
This project has been an incredible journey of learning and passion for game development. Throughout the process, I faced challenges, explored new solutions, and, above all, had immense fun. I hope you find as much enjoyment in playing the CS50 Pong Game as I found in developing it. May this game inspire moments of joy and healthy competition, reminiscent of the simplicity and charm of the early days of the video game industry.

Have fun, and may the best reflexes win!
